        <h2>Structure of an HTML Page</h2>
        <p>An HTML page follows a block-based structure. It all begins with the document type declaration, followed by the tag that wraps all the content. Within the tag, the tag gathers information about the page, such as the title and settings, while the tag contains what actually appears to the user, such as text, images, and links. This separation ensures that the browser understands how to correctly display each part of the website.</p>
